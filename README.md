# Tonal MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides LLMs with access to Tonal fitness data. Built on top of [`@dlwiest/ts-tonal-client`](https://github.com/dlwiest/ts-tonal-client), this server enables AI assistants to answer questions about your workouts, fitness progress, and muscle readiness.

## Features

- 🏋️ **Workout History** - Access recent workout data and performance metrics
- 💪 **Muscle Readiness** - Get recovery status for workout planning
- 📊 **Fitness Statistics** - View lifetime stats, streaks, and progress trends
- 🎯 **Movement Database** - Browse and filter available Tonal exercises
- ✨ **Workout Creation and Editing** - Build and update custom workouts with per-set programming and supersets
- 🔧 **Extensible Architecture** - Easy to add new tools via registry pattern

## Installation

Clone and build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dlwiest/ts-tonal-mcp.git
cd ts-tonal-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration

The server supports multiple Tonal accounts. Credentials are specified per-user using the pattern `TONAL_USERNAME_<USER>` / `TONAL_PASSWORD_<USER>` where `<USER>` is the uppercase account name (e.g. `CARLOS`, `DANIEL`).

```bash
# Primary account (default when no user is specified)
export TONAL_USERNAME_CARLOS="carlos@example.com"
export TONAL_PASSWORD_CARLOS="carlos_password"

# Additional accounts
export TONAL_USERNAME_DANIEL="daniel@example.com"
export TONAL_PASSWORD_DANIEL="daniel_password"
```

Or create a `.env` file:
```env
TONAL_USERNAME_CARLOS=carlos@example.com
TONAL_PASSWORD_CARLOS=carlos_password

TONAL_USERNAME_DANIEL=daniel@example.com
TONAL_PASSWORD_DANIEL=daniel_password
```

> **Migration note:** If you were previously using `TONAL_USERNAME` / `TONAL_PASSWORD`, rename them to `TONAL_USERNAME_CARLOS` / `TONAL_PASSWORD_CARLOS` before restarting the server.

## Usage

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tonal": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/ts-tonal-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TONAL_USERNAME_CARLOS": "carlos@example.com",
        "TONAL_PASSWORD_CARLOS": "carlos_password",
        "TONAL_USERNAME_DANIEL": "daniel@example.com",
        "TONAL_PASSWORD_DANIEL": "daniel_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

Add the server to Claude Code using the CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add tonal-mcp node /path/to/ts-tonal-mcp/dist/index.js \
  -e TONAL_USERNAME_CARLOS=carlos@example.com \
  -e TONAL_PASSWORD_CARLOS=carlos_password \
  -e TONAL_USERNAME_DANIEL=daniel@example.com \
  -e TONAL_PASSWORD_DANIEL=daniel_password
```

### Hermes Agent

Put `TONAL_USERNAME` and `TONAL_PASSWORD` in `~/.hermes/.env`, then register the server under `mcp_servers.tonal` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. Values in `tools.include` are raw tool names such as `get_muscle_readiness`, never registry names such as `mcp__tonal__get_muscle_readiness`. Reload the Hermes gateway/MCP connection before expecting new tools in Telegram sessions.

See [`hermes-tonal`](https://github.com/dlwiest/hermes-tonal) for the complete read-only and full-access configurations and companion skill.

### Direct Usage

```bash
# Run the server directly (stdio mode)
npm start

# Or run the built JavaScript directly
node dist/index.js
```

## Available Tools

The server provides these tools for LLM interactions:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_muscle_readiness` | Get current muscle readiness percentages for recovery planning |
| `get_movements` | Browse Tonal movements/exercises, optionally filtered by muscle groups |
| `search_movements` | Advanced search with 11+ filters (muscle groups, equipment, arm angle, skill level, etc.) |
| `get_recent_workouts` | View recent workout history with summary statistics |
| `get_user_stats` | Get comprehensive fitness statistics and current streak |
| `get_recent_progress` | Analyze recent progress including workout frequency and trends |
| `list_custom_workouts` | List all your custom workouts created on Tonal |
| `create_workout` | Create a new custom workout with exercises, sets, reps/duration, and block grouping |
| `delete_custom_workout` | Delete a custom workout by name; requires `confirm: true` |
| `get_custom_workout_details` | Get detailed information about a custom workout including all sets |
| `get_workout_for_editing` | Get the complete editable structure of an existing workout |
| `update_workout` | Update an existing workout by replacing its full set list |
| `estimate_workout_duration` | Estimate how long a prescribed workout will take, without creating or modifying anything |
| `get_strength_goal_progress` | Get weekly strength-related goal-progress metrics (Strength Sets, Functional Strength Score). **Not** the app's headline Strength Score -- see `get_current_strength_scores`. (Renamed from `get_strength_score`.) |
| `get_current_strength_scores` | Get Tonal's headline per-region Strength Score (Upper Body, Core, Lower Body, Overall) -- the score shown in the app |
| `get_strength_score_history` | Get per-workout Strength Score history; `days` is a calendar-day lookback (default `'all'`), not a row count |
| `get_tonal_achievements` | Get achievement progress, next milestones, and full earned-achievement history (most-recent-first) |

### Per-set programming

`create_workout` and `update_workout` accept `setDetails` when sets differ. Each entry may contain `reps`, `duration`, `weight`, `warmUp`, `dropSet`, `burnout`, and `description`. When present, `setDetails` is authoritative and its length is the set count. Without it, the existing `sets`, `reps`, `duration`, and `weight` fields still create uniform sets.

```json
{
  "title": "Bench Progression",
  "exercises": [
    {
      "movementName": "Bench Press",
      "setDetails": [
        { "reps": 10, "weight": 40, "warmUp": true },
        { "reps": 8, "weight": 55 },
        { "reps": 6, "weight": 65, "dropSet": true }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Deletion also requires an explicit opt-in. Pass the exact workout name and `"confirm": true` to `delete_custom_workout`; requests without confirmation do not delete anything.

## Example Conversations

With the MCP server connected, you can ask Claude:

**Fitness Insights:**
- *"Should I work out today?"* → Gets muscle readiness data
- *"What did I do this week?"* → Shows recent workout history
- *"How's my progress lately?"* → Analyzes recent metrics and trends
- *"Am I staying consistent with my workouts?"* → Reviews frequency and streaks

**Exercise Discovery:**
- *"What chest exercises are available?"* → Filters movements by muscle group
- *"Show me beginner-friendly leg exercises"* → Searches with skill level filter
- *"Find exercises that use the bench"* → Filters by equipment

**Workout Management:**
- *"Show me my custom workouts"* → Lists all your created workouts
- *"Create a push/pull workout with warmup and cooldown"* → Builds a structured workout
- *"Show me details for 'Upper Body Blast'"* → View full workout structure with all sets
- *"Edit 'Upper Body Blast' and make its last set a drop set"* → Fetches the editable structure, then replaces the workout's full set list
- *"Delete my workout called 'Old Routine'"* → Removes a specific custom workout

## Development

### Adding New Tools

Thanks to the registry pattern, adding new tools is straightforward:

1. Create your tool function in the appropriate file (e.g., `src/tools/analytics.ts`)
2. Add the tool definition to `src/tools/registry.ts`
3. The server automatically discovers and registers new tools

## Protocol
